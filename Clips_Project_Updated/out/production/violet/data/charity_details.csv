design_society_the,"Design Society, The",IPC,T09SS0071G,From 18/01/2018 to 17/01/2019,75 JALAN KELABU ASAP Singapore 278268,Arts and Heritage,Others,"The Design Society Lecture Series We plan to hold lectures and talks at secondary schools, junior colleges, polytechnics, universities to supplement the existing school design syllabus or as an add-on topic for students who are keen to know more about design beyond what is being offered in their schools / institutions. This should encourage students to be more design centric and more 'design educated'. Mobile Educational Exhibitions Program The Design Society will present a series of touring mobile educational exhibitions in the local tertiary and secondary schools. The exhibitions will present original theme and content based on it's design archive and local educational program. The exhibitions will serve as platforms to educate, inspire and interact. It is dedicated to bridging and connecting the local design community to the educators and students. The Design Society hopes to share and promote design knowledge and appreciation to the developing minds of Singapore's future generation. Singapore Design Archive The Design Society will launch a design archive to collect, preserve and document Singapore's design history and works. The ongoing collection will be easily accessible in order to facilitate understanding, research and writing in the field. Acknowledging its position as more than a static collection of material waiting to be discovered, The Design Society's Singapore Design Archive endeavours to be pro-active in instigating dialogue and critical thinking through the regular initiation of educational and public programs, and in introducing as wide an audience as possible to this rich resource. The archive's collection will be both physical and digital. An online archive gallery will be launched and maintained. Bi-Annual Public Exhibitions The Design Society will present 2 public exhibitions every year. The exhibitions will be open to the Society's members and public. The exhibitions will be presented in collaboration with local institutions and museums. The exhibitions will present original themes and content based on its design archive collection, international industry / institutional partnership, local educational program and annual design forum. The exhibitions will serve as platforms to educate, inspire and interact. The Design Society is dedicated to the conversation between the past and future of Singapore's design culture. Bi-Annual Design Publications One of the first priorities of the Society is to address the lack of a local publication dedicated to serious and professional discourse on graphic design. The proposed twice-yearly schedule will allow the editorial team to gather and follow through with research and reportage on major design events and projects. We intend for the inaugural issue to signal a new maturity in critical thinking and desire to raise our standards for design knowledge. Beginning with members of the Society, the publication will also be distributed to high profile individuals and leaders in related fields and industries in Singapore and across the Asia Pacific region. With the quality of content and a highly targeted audience, the publication is set to become an important milestone for the Singapore design scene",31-12-09,Live,Registered,http://www.thedesignsociety.sg,NEW OPERA SINGAPORE LTD.,201114924K,Arts and Heritage,"Music & Orchestras,Theatre & Dramatic Arts",http://www.newoperasingapore.sg,DING YI MUSIC COMPANY LTD.,201101809W,Arts and Heritage,Music & Orchestras,http://www.dingyimusic.com,KRETA AYER PEOPLE'S THEATRE FOUNDATION,197500851C,Arts and Heritage,Traditional Ethnic Performing Arts,http://www.kapt.com.sg,T.H.E DANCE COMPANY LTD.,200818017E,Arts and Heritage,"Professional, Contemporary & Ethnic Dance",http://www.the-dancecompany.com,LEE KUAN YEW FUND FOR BILINGUALISM,201204335M,Arts and Heritage,Historical & Cultural Conservation,http://www.bilingualism.sg,SINGAPORE ART MUSEUM,201330746G,Arts and Heritage,Visual Arts,http://www.singaporeartmuseum.sg,THE RICE COMPANY LIMITED,201408699H,Arts and Heritage,"Music & Orchestras,Others,Professional, Contemporary & Ethnic Dance,Theatre & Dramatic Arts,Training & Education,Visual Arts",http://therice.sg/,FRONTIER DANCELAND LTD.,201127710M,Arts and Heritage,"Professional, Contemporary & Ethnic Dance",www.frontierdanceland.com,SOCIAL CREATIVES LTD.,200813216C,Arts and Heritage,"Historical & Cultural Conservation,Others,Visual Arts",http://www.socialcreatives.com,BEAUTIFUL MIND CHARITY,T12SS0009G,Arts and Heritage,"Music & Orchestras,Others,Training & Education",http://www.bmcsg.org,NINE YEARS THEATRE LTD.,201221584C,Arts and Heritage,Theatre & Dramatic Arts,nineyearstheatre.com,TEMENGGONG ARTISTSINRESIDENCE LTD.,200916397C,Arts and Heritage,Visual Arts,Not applicable,O SCHOOL LTD.,200905934E,Arts and Heritage,"Professional, Contemporary & Ethnic Dance,Training & Education",http://www.oschool.com.sg,INTERCULTURAL THEATRE INSTITUTE LTD.,200818680E,Arts and Heritage,"Theatre & Dramatic Arts,Training & Education",http://www.iti.edu.sg,I THEATRE LTD.,200802928D,Arts and Heritage,Theatre & Dramatic Arts,http://www.itheatre.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We will continue to expend efforts to build up the common chest for the various Catholic charities and social groups under our umbrella. Charities Week remains our primary fundraising event. In addition, we hope to tap the support of corporates, groups and individuals within and outside the Catholic community through organised fundraising programmes. 2. Grant Making. Funds will be channelled to our member organisations to support their work and programmes. This will be done through a formal grants review process wherein grant applications from members will be duly screened and evaluated by the Finance and Grants Committee and approved by the Boards of Caritas Singapore and Trustees of the Agape Fund. 3. Membership and Capacity Building. Caritas Singapore facilitates networking among our 23 member organisations under our umbrella. We maintain regular contact with them in a structured manner to identify needs and common issues and to coordinate support to meet such needs. 4. Volunteering. Caritas Singapore promotes the spirit of volunteering and facilitates the mobilisation of volunteers in the Catholic community for our member organisations. This is part of our ongoing efforts to engage the Catholic community to serve the poor and those in need. 5. Community Strategy. Caritas Singapore has formulated an overall community landscape and strategy. We will work together with our member organisations to implement new programmes and enhance existing services to better serve community needs. 6. Shared Services and Support. Caritas Singapore seeks to synergise resources across our many Catholic social mission groups, and enhance service delivery through collaboration. We encourage our member organisations to work together. 7. Formation. We will continue to educate and inform the Catholic community on the importance of living out the Christian call in reaching out to those who are less fortunate in the community. 8. Communications: Our web portal, Facebook page and dedicated page in the fortnightly Catholic News publication remain our key communication channels to disseminate our work to our stakeholders. 9. Governance: We continue to uphold good corporate governance in our work and ensure transparencies to our stakeholders. We will also work with our member organisations to review how the Caritas Code of Governance can be adapted for their use. 10. Advocacy. Caritas Singapore work in partnership with our member organisations to help the broader community become more aware of the causes and plight faced by the poor and marginalised. 11. Agape Village. Caritas Singapore embarked on the construction of a one-stop Catholic social services hub which will bring together the resources and services of our 23 social mission groups virtually under one roof to provide integrated, holistic and upstream services for our beneficiaries and anyone in the community that needs help",12-01-06,Not applicable,Registered,http://www.caritas-singapore.org,Calvary Community Care,T10SS0047C,Social and Welfare,Community,calvary.sg,MONTFORT CARE,200814118E,Social and Welfare,"Children/Youth,Community,Eldercare,Family",http://www.montfortcare.org.sg,COUNCIL FOR THIRD AGE,200708621W,Social and Welfare,Community,http://www.c3a.org.sg,TOUCH FAMILY SERVICES LIMITED,200703355N,Social and Welfare,"Children/Youth,Community,Family",http://www.tcs.org.sg,NTUCU CARE FUND,T09CC0008D,Social and Welfare,"Children/Youth,Community,Eldercare,Family",http://www.ntuc.org.sg/ucare,Centre for Seniors,T06SS0199E,Social and Welfare,"Community,Eldercare",http://www.centreforseniors.org.sg,TEMASEK FOUNDATION CARES CLG LIMITED,200909154Z,Social and Welfare,"Children/Youth,Community,Disability (Adult),Disability (Children),Eldercare,Family",http://www.temasekfoundation-cares.org.sg,BLC COMMUNITY SERVICES LTD.,200813317G,Social and Welfare,Community,Not applicable,"New Charis Mission, The",T06SS0166B,Social and Welfare,"Children/Youth,Community,Family,Support Groups",http://www.thenewcharismission.org.sg,XiSer CareServe,T05SS0221K,Social and Welfare,Eldercare,http://www.dabei.org.sg/en-001-009-tpss.html,"NEW COMMUNITY FAMILY CENTRE, THE",T05SS0136D,Social and Welfare,Community,Not applicable,HOPEHOUSE LTD.,201010093H,Social and Welfare,Children/Youth,Not applicable,NCSS CHARITABLE FUND,T03CC1692B,Social and Welfare,Community,http://www.ncss.org.sg,CANOSSA MISSION SINGAPORE,201020087W,Social and Welfare,Children/Youth,Not applicable,Neighbour Ring Community Services,T03SS0118J,Social and Welfare,Community,Not applicable,NEW REDEEMER'S FELLOWSHIP SOCIETY,T07SS0228C,Social and Welfare,"Community,Family,Support Groups",https://www.giving.sg/new-redeemer-s-fellowship-society,WOH HUP TRUST,201129946W,Social and Welfare,Community,Not applicable,ARC LEARNING ACADEMY LTD.,201112356K,Social and Welfare,Disability (Adult),http://www.autism.org.sg,BRAHM CENTRE LTD.,200200167M,Social and Welfare,"Children/Youth,Community,Disability (Adult),Eldercare,Family,Support Groups",http://www.brahmcentre.com,CAPE OF COLOURS LTD.,201135738K,Social and Welfare,Children/Youth,http://www.capeofcolours.org,THE FOOD BANK SINGAPORE LTD.,201200654E,Social and Welfare,Community,http://www.foodbank.sg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
