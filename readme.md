## KE4102 INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNIQUES FOR BUSINESS ANALYTICS Group Project 

This was a group project demonstrating the use of CLIPS in the inference of rules in a rule-based system. The end result was a Java application that demonstrated how the user could get a set of charity recommendation results. 
The base engine is a rule-based system based on CLIPS.
Machine learning techniques such as K-nearest neighbours clustering were used to derive more results from the original set of results.
